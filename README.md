# Assignment Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for Lab 10: Exploring Advanced Python Tools for Machine Learning & AI. 
Python and Jupyter Notebook will be used to analyze the well-known Titanic dataset for this assignment. 
The RMS Titanic passengers' survivor status, age, sex, passenger class, and other details are all included in the Titanic dataset. 
The primary goals are to forecast passenger survival, exploratory data analysis, handling of missing values and outliers, feature engineering, and the implementation and evaluation of machine learning models on the dataset.
## Dataset Selection Rationale

The dataset used in this assignment is the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset was chosen because it is a classic and well-known dataset suitable for binary classification tasks. 
Derived from the real-life tragedy of the Titanic sinking, it allows us to explore a real-world scenario and predict passenger survival. 
With a rich feature set and data cleaning challenges, it provides valuable learning opportunities for data analysis and machine learning. 
Its simplicity and interpretability make it an ideal choice for educational and practice purposes.

## How to Run the Code
To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:git clone [repository_url]
2. Install the required dependencies (if any). For this assignment, the main dependencies are Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
It can be installed  them using pip: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn
3. Navigate to the directory containing the code: cd [repository_name]
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab: jupyter notebook Titanic_Analysis.ipynb
5. Execute the cells in the notebook to run the code and see the results.
